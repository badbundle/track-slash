# Security model

What each kind of user can reach, the rules every surface follows, and the
trade-offs trackslash accepts on purpose. Read this before changing permissions,
authentication, project access, comments, notifications or realtime. Report a
vulnerability as [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) describes, never in a public issue.

## Who can see what

`ProjectPermissionsForUser` in `internal/store/permissions.go` is the single
source of a user's rights in a project.

| Who | Reads | Writes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Site admin, project owner | Everything | Everything, including members, access and deleting the project |
| Member | Everything, including members-only comments and deleted issues | Issues, comments, sprints, context, whiteboard |
| Read-only member | Everything, including members-only comments and deleted issues | Nothing |
| Public viewer (`public`, `public_issues`) | Live issues and their shared comments | Files issues in `public_issues` only |
| Help-desk reporter (non-member of a `helpdesk` project) | Only issues they reported, as a `ReporterIssue`, and their shared comments | Files issues (title and description) and replies |
| Blocked user | Nothing: 403 everywhere in the project | Nothing |

- **Help-desk reporters get no project-level read at all.** Only the reporter
  paths open (see `helpdesk.go`). Every route that names an issue goes through
  `issueRouteAccess`, which answers another reporter's issue exactly as it would
  a missing one.
- **Public projects are link-only.** Anyone with the link can read one, but
  lists name a project only to its owner and members: the Projects page and an
  owner's projects page, the `/` redirect, Me, the new-issue project picker,
  `GET /api/v1/projects` and `track_list_projects`. Site admins get the same
  lists; their wider access works by link. Recents and Favorites record the
  user's own history, so a public project opened by link can appear there.
- **Members-only data stays with members.** That covers members-only comments,
  block history, deleted issues and the files only they hold, the changelog
  about them, and deleted comments' previews. Members-only comments never reach
  anyone else, whether through the API, MCP, the UI, the changelog, push
  notifications or realtime.
- **Emails are never shown outside the account itself.** Member lists, pickers,
  comment authors and the reporter view name people by display name or
  username. Member search matches emails only for someone who manages members.

## Rules every surface follows

- **REST, MCP and the UI apply the same check for the same action.** A new route
  or tool resolves its entity through the existing helpers (`issueFromRoute`,
  `mcpIssue`, `uiIssueFromRoute`, `projectFromRoute`, and so on) and then checks
  the right permission on the project that entity belongs to.
- **Something the caller may not see is missing, not forbidden.** This applies to
  a hidden comment and to another reporter's issue.
- **Credentials are the account's own.** A connector (OAuth) token cannot read
  or change tokens, email, password, password login, passkeys, saved GitHub
  tokens, or site-admin account administration. See [OAUTH.md](OAUTH.md).
- **Guesses are budgeted.** Password sign-in, password changes, reauthentication
  and OAuth client authentication share per-address and per-identifier failure
  budgets (`auth_rate_limit.go`).
- **Uploads are inert.** Only safe raster images are served inline and with
  their own type. Everything else is sent as an octet-stream download with a
  sandbox CSP.

## Accepted trade-offs

These are known and left as they are. Change one only with that in mind.

- **Existence can be probed.** A signed-in outsider gets 403 for a private
  project or issue that exists and 404 for one that does not.
  `/{owner}/projects` answers 404 for an unknown username. Project keys and
  usernames are not secrets. Help-desk reporters are the exception: another
  reporter's issue is always 404.
- **Help-desk refs reveal counts.** Issue numbers run per project and comment
  numbers per issue. A reporter's own refs therefore show roughly how many
  issues the project has, and gaps show that members-only comments exist. Refs
  have to stay stable and shareable.
- **Public projects list their members.** Anyone who can read a project can
  list its members' usernames, names and roles over REST and MCP, though only
  managers see the members page. Usernames already appear on issues.
- **GitHub metadata follows the project's visibility.** If a public project
  connects a private repository, its readers see the repository name and the
  linked branch and pull request titles.
- **Images are stored as uploaded,** metadata included.
- **Session cookies do not use the `__Host-` prefix.** They are HttpOnly,
  SameSite=Lax, Secure over https and have no Domain. Renaming them would sign
  everyone out.
- **Ending sessions leaves API tokens and connectors alive.** "Sign out
  everywhere" and a password change end web sessions only. API tokens and
  connected apps are listed on Tokens and ended there.
- **Creating a token or registering a connector needs no reauthentication,**
  and the token can outlive the session that made it.
- **Passkey sign-count regressions are recorded, not refused.** Synced passkeys
  report zero.
- **Emails are not verified.** Setting an email another account holds fails
  with a conflict, which tells the caller that the email is registered.
  `trackd -create-admin-token` will not promote an existing non-admin who holds
  the email unless `-promote-existing` is passed.
- **Storage object JSON names its backend, bucket and key.** These are
  locations, not credentials.
- **Realtime access is checked once, on subscribe.** Events carry only IDs, and
  every refetch checks access again. Changes to access, blocks or membership,
  and deleting a user, disconnect every client so it has to reauthorize. A token
  revoked mid-connection keeps its socket until it reconnects. With several
  replicas, a disconnect reaches only the replica that handled the change.
- **Rate limits live in each process,** so several replicas multiply the
  budgets.
- **Anyone can spend a username's sign-in budget.** Ten failed password
  attempts in five minutes hold up that account's password sign-in for the rest
  of the window, though passkey sign-in still works. This is the cost of a
  per-account budget against distributed guessing.
- **The changelog keeps edit history.** The before and after previews of an
  edited issue or comment stay visible to whoever can read the changelog.
- **Blocks do not apply to site admins.**
- **In public projects, comments are shared by default,** as they always were.
  Help desks default to members-only.
