# Component Reference

Reusable server-rendered UI components live in `internal/server/templates/components.html`. Prefer these before adding new markup to feature templates.

## Navigation

- `breadcrumb`: subtle entity hierarchy navigation backed by `uiBreadcrumbData`. Project pages show `Projects / Project name / Current view`; issue pages append the current issue key to the project, with a parent issue key between them for sub-issues. The issue Context manager links the issue key and appends `Context` as the current item.
- `tab-bar`: single-line sibling-view navigation with optional Lucide icons, backed by `uiTabBarData`. Set an item's `MobileOverflow` flag when its owning page provides an equivalent constrained-screen overflow-menu link; those tabs return at `lg`.
- `sidebar-favorites`: shell sidebar favorite-project shortcuts backed by `uiSidebarFavoritesData`, under a small uppercase `Favorites` heading (hidden with the other wide-only labels when the sidebar is collapsed). Keep it directly below the `Projects` nav item with a subtle divider from standard navigation, and refresh it with OOB HTMX swaps when favorite state changes.
- `sidebar-recents`: the sidebar's `Recents` list below Favorites, backed by `uiSidebarRecentsData`. It shows the up to ten issues the signed-in user opened most recently, newest first; each row is an `issue-key` and a one-line title. `renderUIShell` loads it (`store.ListRecentIssues`, which drops issues the user can no longer read). The issue page and panel record each view (`store.RecordIssueView`); an htmx panel also swaps the list in out of band. The whole section is wide-only, so the collapsed sidebar hides it. On an issue page the issue's Recents entry, not its project, is the one active destination: the panel's `data-sidebar-view` element carries `data-sidebar-issue-id`, and `app.js` falls back to the project while the entry is hidden.
- Truncation tooltips: a control with visible text can add `data-tooltip` plus `data-tooltip-when-truncated`, and mark the clipped element `data-tooltip-truncates`. The shared app tooltip then shows only while that text is cut off, as Recents does for long titles.
- Account menu: the menu inside the sidebar's account footer in `shell_sidebar.html` ranges over `accountPages` (`uiAccountPages`, a list of `uiAccountPage` with `View`, `Label`, `Path`, and Lucide `Icon`) and ends with the `Sign out` form below a divider. Each account panel sets `data-sidebar-view` to its page's `View`, and its handler renders through `renderUIAccountPage` so the matching `data-account-menu-link` is marked current; `app.js` keeps that mark in step after htmx navigation and closes the menu when an item is chosen.
- `legal-links`: compact links to the canonical Terms, Privacy, and Security pages. Reuse it on signed-out pages; authenticated account pages get it through `account-footer`, so the published documents remain consistently reachable.
- `account-footer`: bordered page footer wrapping `legal-links`. Every account page (Profile, Login, Notifications, Tokens) ends with it; it takes no data.
- `issue-list-controls`: collapsible shared status, priority, tag, assignee, sort, and direction controls for issue list views. Closed by default; summary shows active filter count plus current sort/direction. Sort uses dropdown options including due date; direction uses Asc/Desc dropdown options with arrow icons. Expects `uiIssueControlsData`; omit tag fields for cross-project lists and omit assignee fields for current-user scoped lists.

## Brand

Brand building blocks live in `internal/server/templates/brand.html`; see "Brand" in `DESIGN_CONTEXT.md`.

- `brand-head`: the icon, apple-touch icon, manifest, theme colour, and stylesheet links. Every full-page document includes it inside `<head>`, so no page ships without the icon or the stylesheet.
- `brand-backdrop`: the animated brand scene, a fixed, clipped, pointer-events-free layer at `z-index: -1` placed directly inside `<body>`. Pass `""` for the full scene behind a single centered card (auth and OAuth pages) or `"ambient"` for the calmer version behind the app shell and legal pages. Any surface that sits straight on the page must be opaque.
- `brand-mark`: the 28px icon and `trackslash` wordmark lockup for page chrome (sidebar head, mobile app bar, legal header). Wrap it in a link where the chrome needs one; it takes no data.
- Navigation progress: `shell.html` renders one `<div data-nav-progress class="nav-progress">` under `<body>`. `app.js` sets `data-nav-busy` on `<html>` while any htmx request targeting `#main` is in flight, and the stylesheet fades the bar in after a short delay.
- `statusSurface` / `statusCard`: status tints for cards that sit straight on the page (the issue header, board cards). They lay the translucent `statusRow` tint over an opaque page-colour base; `statusCard` adds the row hover tint for linked cards. Use `statusRow` only for rows inside an opaque list card.

## Signed-out Auth Pages

- `auth-page-open` and `auth-page-close` in `internal/server/templates/login.html`: the shared document shell for `login`, `signup`, `oauth-consent`, and `oauth-error`. Pass the page's CSRF token (or `""` when the page has no form) to `auth-page-open`. It renders `brand-head`, the full `brand-backdrop`, and opens the centered card with the icon and `trackslash` wordmark, so page headings inside the card are `h2`. Put the page body between the two templates. `auth-page-close` closes the card, adds `legal-links`, and loads `auth.js`, which also renders the page's Lucide icons.
- Login password disclosure: `<details data-password-login>` holds the username/password form below the primary passkey button. The server renders it `open` when the page carries a password-login error; `auth.js` opens it when WebAuthn is unavailable and focuses the username field whenever it opens.

## Controls

- App tooltip: one body-level tooltip in `shell_scripts.html` automatically labels interactive controls that have an `aria-label` but no visible text. It appears on pointer hover and keyboard focus, follows the control through the shared CSS anchor in `frontend/tailwind.css`, and stays outside card overflow. Keep labels concise and action-oriented; do not add a tooltip to controls whose text is already visible.
- `local-time`: semantic timestamp backed by `uiLocalTimeData` from `tokenTime`. It keeps canonical UTC in `datetime`, renders an explicit UTC fallback, and is enhanced by `app.js` into the browser's local date, time, and timezone on initial load and after HTMX swaps.

## Badges

- `issue-key`: compact monospace issue identifier badge. Use it for ticket numbers wherever possible; if a generic data-driven badge must show an issue identifier, mirror this component's monospace, uppercase, compact bordered treatment.
- `project-key`: compact project key badge.
- `access-badge`: icon-and-label badge for a project access setting, from a `uiAccessBadge`. The open or on state is tinted emerald and the restricted or off state is neutral. Build it with `projectVisibilityBadge` (`Public` globe / `Private` lock), `projectIssueCreationBadge` (`Any signed-in user` users / `Members only` user-round-check) or `projectSprintModeBadge` (`Enabled` person-standing / `Disabled` list-checks). Each carries its setting's data hook (`data-project-visibility`, `data-project-issue-creation`, `data-project-sprint-mode`) so tests and scripts can read the state without parsing copy.
- `sprint-ref`: compact monospace canonical sprint-reference badge. Keep the `sprint-N` value lowercase and pair it with sprint titles on current, planned, and historical cards.
- `count-badge`: small numeric count badge.
- `sprint-issue-count-badge`: compact sprint-total badge that uses `Issue` for one and `Issues` for zero or multiple while reusing `count-badge` styling.
- `status-badge`: issue status badge using `statusClass`.
- `close-reason-badge`: close reason badge for closed issues.
- `missing-close-reason-badge`: dashed placeholder for invalid or incomplete closed issue detail states.
- `priority-badge`: circular P0-P4 priority marker.
- `tag-badge`: compact hashtag badge for `model.IssueTag`, using `DisplayName` and `tagClass .Color`.
- `issue-due-badge`: due-date badge with overdue/today/future styling.
- `issue-sprint-badge`: 20px indigo square with a visible `S`, from a `model.Sprint`. It marks an issue that is in a sprint. The `S` is `aria-hidden`; the shared app tooltip (`data-tooltip`) and a screen-reader label both read `In sprint-N · Name (status)`. It carries `data-issue-sprint-badge="sprint-N"`. It isn't interactive, so it can sit inside a row link.

## Avatars

- `user-avatar`: circular user avatar with thumbnail-or-initials fallback. Pass `userAvatar <user-like value> <class>` where the value is `model.User`, `model.ProjectMember`, `model.ProjectAssignee`, `model.ProjectAssigneeIssueStats`, `model.ProjectChangelogActor`, or `uiIssueCommentItem`. The shared component owns the circular crop and clipping; callers own dimensions, colors, and borders through the class string. The helper adds cache-busting thumbnail URLs with `?v={thumbnail_object_id}` and falls back to initials from display name, username, or email.
- `project-icon`: square project image with a small corner radius and project-initial fallback, backed by `uiProjectIconData`. Pass `projectIcon <project> <class>`; the helper adds a cache-busting thumbnail URL and the component owns the square crop and radius.

## Forms

- `csrf-field`: hidden `csrf_token` input. Every form with `method="post"` must include it as `{{template "csrf-field" $.CSRFToken}}`, which means the data passed to that template needs a `CSRFToken` field populated from `uiSessionCSRFToken(r)`. `TestEveryPostFormRendersACSRFField` fails the build if a posting form omits it, and `TestRenderedPagesCarryAPopulatedCSRFToken` fails if a construction site leaves it empty.
- `option-dropdown`: expanded dropdown/listbox for choosing one option and submitting immediately. Backed by `uiOptionDropdownData`; use for compact enum-like changes such as issue status and close reason.
- `autocomplete-input` and `autocomplete-options`: shared search/autofill building blocks backed by `uiAutocompleteEditData` and `uiAutocompleteOption`. Supports local option filtering, optional hidden target values, addressable option containers, collapsible suggestions, and optional debounced HTMX refresh on input for server-filtered suggestions.
- `autocomplete-edit`: search-style edit row with suggestions and save/cancel actions. Use for member, sprint, and similar lookup fields.

## Modals

- `modal-open` and `modal-close`: reusable modal shell with title, optional description, badges, and cancel action. Wrap workflow-specific body content between the two templates. Client-controlled modals may set `Open` when a validation response must keep the modal visible; the shared script focuses the first form control after open or an HTMX swap.
- Add/create controls on management pages open this shared modal instead of permanently rendering a second form beside existing content. Dedicated creation pages remain full-page workflows; Context remains the documented integrated-manager exception.
- `image-picker`: shared client-controlled profile/project image modal backed by `uiImagePickerData`. Keep only the current avatar/icon and its Add/Change trigger in the owning panel; file selection, upload, and removal live inside this modal. Profile previews remain circular and project previews remain square with a small corner radius.
- Issue-scoped relationship edits should prefer modals when the user is making a small local change from issue detail. Issue Context is the deliberate exception because browsing and editing multiple documents benefits from its integrated manager. Other modal workflows should keep the surrounding issue visible, avoid URL pushes for open/submit/close, support repeated HTMX updates, and link out when the task expands.
- Issue tag modal convention: show attached tags first, then a searchable list of available project tags. Attach/detach existing tags only; create/edit/delete project tags stays in the project tag manager.

## Rows And Notices

- `issue-summary-row`: responsive issue list row content accepting a `uiIssueItem`. It stacks key/priority, title/tags, and due/status metadata on mobile, then restores the compact four-column row from `sm` upward. When `SubIssueProgress.Total` is non-zero, it also shows the shared compact completed/total ring used on sprint cards. When `SprintBadge` is set, it shows `issue-sprint-badge` after the due badge. Only lists that are not already grouped by sprint set it.
- `issue-delete-notice`: restore notice shown after deleting an issue.
- Shell responses: `renderUIShell` renders the whole document for a navigation and only `shell-main-content` for an htmx request. Every htmx control targets a sub-element, and `#main` is a sibling of the sidebar inside `.app-shell`, so answering htmx with a document swaps a second header, sidebar, and `#main` into the existing `#main`. Add new whole-page panels to `shell-main-content`, never to the `shell-main` wrapper.
- `error-panel`: shell-hosted error page backed by `uiErrorPanelData` (status, title, message), with copy from `uiErrorPageFor`. Rendered through `renderUIShell` so signed-in visitors keep their sidebar. Unmatched URLs get it from `uiNotFound`. In the signed-in route group, the `uiErrorPages` middleware turns any plain-text 4xx/5xx (`writeUIStoreError`, `http.Error`) answered to a browser page navigation (a `GET` that accepts `text/html` and isn't htmx) into this page with the same status; htmx, fetch, image, and websocket requests keep the plain-text body. Add new whole-page error states here rather than hand-rolling error markup.
- Context detail row: issue detail uses a Details-sidebar row labeled `Context`, a `count-badge`, and a compact book-open action that opens the integrated issue Context manager and pushes its URL. Project About does not render context; project context is a top-level tab.

## Feature Panels

- `project-favorite-action`: project header star toggle backed by `uiProjectFavoriteData`/`uiProjectPanelData`. Keep it adjacent to the project title and update only the action wrapper plus `sidebar-favorites`.
- `project-panel-context`: integrated project Context tab in `internal/server/templates/project_panel_context.html`; expects `uiContextManagerData` through `uiProjectPanelData.ContextManager`. It owns the ordered page list, selected Markdown page, and complete linked-issue list in a separate section below the document card.
- Tokens page: API tokens keep a per-row list with individual revoke; web sessions collapse to a live count and one **Revoke all web sessions** action. Sessions are numerous and their names carry no information, so a row each buried the tokens people actually manage. The action revokes the caller's own session too and signs them out.
- Tokens page, Connectors section: registered OAuth clients keep a per-row list with individual revoke, between API tokens and web sessions. Connector access tokens collapse to a live count for the same reason sessions do — they are reissued hourly by the connector itself. Registration uses the shared `modal-open`/`modal-close` modal through `oauthClientCreateModal`, which follows the API token modal's create-then-reveal-once convention: `ClientControlled` with `Open` set when there is an error to show or a secret to reveal. The client secret is hashed at rest, so the modal is the only place it is ever displayed.
- `oauth-consent` and `oauth-error` in `internal/server/templates/oauth_consent.html`: standalone documents backed by `uiOAuthConsentData` and `uiOAuthErrorData`, styled as a plain centered card rather than rendered through `renderUIShell`, and without the signed-out auth backdrop. They are interstitials shown on behalf of a third party, not pages of the product, so they deliberately carry no sidebar or shell chrome. See `OAUTH.md`.
- `project-delete-modal`: destructive project deletion dialog in `internal/server/templates/project_panel.html`, backed by `projectDeleteModal` and the `DeleteProject*` fields on `uiProjectPanelData`. The project actions menu links to `/{owner}/projects/{key}/delete`, which re-renders the panel with the dialog open; the same URL performs the deletion on POST. It states the consequences, requires the project key to be typed, and is only rendered when `CanDeleteProject` is set. Destructive actions this broad get a typed confirmation rather than `hx-confirm`, which stays right for single-row deletes.
- `range-control` in `components.html`: a segmented row of links that reloads the current project view over a different window, backed by `uiRangeControl`/`uiRangeOption` and built in templates with `rangeControl "<aria label>" .Options`. The active option carries `aria-current="true"`. Insights uses it for its date range and In progress for its completion window; reuse it rather than drawing another segmented control.
- `project-panel-progress` in `internal/server/templates/project_panel_progress.html`: the In progress view shown instead of Planned when sprints are off, backed by `uiProjectProgressData` (built in `ui_project_progress.go` from the shared `projectProgress` helper that also serves the API and MCP). It renders the `In progress` and `Recently completed` sections with the shared `issue-list`; recently completed items set `uiIssueItem.CompletedAt`, which `issue-summary-row` shows before the status badge. `ProgressNotice` on the panel shows a one-line explanation above both sections.
- `project-panel-insights` and `insight-chart` in `internal/server/templates/project_panel_insights.html`: the project Insights view and its reusable chart card, backed by `uiProjectInsightsData` and `uiInsightChart` (built in `ui_insight_charts.go`). A chart card owns its title, description, stat row, legend toggles, plot, notes, and `Data table` disclosure. Kinds are `line`, `area` (stacked), `bars` (grouped, one column per period), and `scatter`. Lines and areas draw in a stretched `0 0 1000 1000` viewBox with non-scaling strokes; text, dots, bars, and gridlines use percentage coordinates so they keep their shape at any width. The server embeds tooltip data as JSON in `data-insight-chart`, and `app.js` adds the crosshair, per-series hover markers, tooltips (from the `data-insight-tooltip-*` templates, filled with `textContent`), arrow-key stepping, tap-to-inspect, and legend toggles. Nothing writes inline scripts or styles, which the CSP forbids: the tooltip lives in an SVG `foreignObject` that moves by its `x`/`y` attributes. Set `Empty` for an empty state instead of drawing an empty plot.
- `project-member-page`: full project access manager in `internal/server/templates/project_member_page.html`; expects member, public-access, sprint-mode (`Project.SprintsEnabled`, `SprintModeLocked`, `SprintModeError`), and blocked-user fields on `uiProjectPanelData`. Keep the owner fixed, use avatar/name/username rows with inline role selectors, keep public issue creation subordinate to public read-only access, keep the `Sprints` setting in its own form beside `Public access` and lock it while a sprint is active, require an exact username when blocking, and re-render the page after each mutation.
- `project-panel-whiteboard`: integrated project Whiteboard tab in `internal/server/templates/project_panel_whiteboard.html`; expects `uiWhiteboardData` through `uiProjectPanelData.Whiteboard`, built by `uiBuildProjectPanel` so the project header keeps every permitted action. It owns the most-recently-updated-first title list and one selected, created, or edited Markdown page, reusing `description-editor` (without upload configuration) and `description-body`. It never renders issue-linking or attachment UI.
- `context-manager-panel`: routes issue mode to the integrated list/document manager in `internal/server/templates/issue_context_manager.html`; project mode remains a compatibility fallback because project Context normally renders through `project-panel-context`.
- `description-body`: shared safe Markdown display backed by `uiDescriptionBodyData`. Project, issue, and sprint adapters pass attachment-scoped rendered HTML.
- `description-editor`: shared Markdown textarea backed by `uiDescriptionEditorData`, with optional upload and attachment-list URLs. Creation forms omit upload configuration until a parent ref exists.
- `description-attachment-list`: shared project/issue/sprint attachment rows backed by `uiAttachmentListData`, including previews, metadata, Markdown copy, download, delete, pagination notice, and editing state.
- `sprint-description`: shared active/planned/completed-history sprint cropped-Markdown preview backed by `uiSprintDescriptionData` or the matching fields on `uiPlannedSprint`. It lazily swaps full Markdown and attachment rows through `See more` without affecting the sprint-issues disclosure.

### Context Page Conventions

- Project tab route: `/{owner}/projects/{key}/context`; selected pages use `/context/{contextRef}`. Issue manager route: `/{owner}/issues/{issueRef}/context`, with the same selected-page suffix.
- Project pages support create/import/edit/delete, page-scoped attachments, ordering, and linked-issue management. The page list stays compact without per-page issue counts; only the selected page renders content, followed by its complete linked-issue list and count.
- Markdown pages use the shared safe Markdown renderer and attachment components. Plain-text imports remain escaped and pre-wrapped.
- Issue manager mode supports creating and editing issue-scoped context, attaching and viewing project pages read-only, and removing links in the same responsive list/document pattern as project Context.
- User-facing attach/search controls use context titles. Do not present refs such as `context-1` as visible identifiers, badges, placeholders, or option labels.

### Whiteboard Page Conventions

- Project tab route: `/{owner}/projects/{key}/whiteboard`; selected pages use `/whiteboard/{whiteboard-N}`, with `/new`, `/{ref}/edit`, and `/{ref}/delete` for writers.
- Pages are title plus Markdown only. They render through the shared safe Markdown pipeline with no attachment store, so external images stay inert links and `object-N` refs stay text.
- Delete uses a single `hx-confirm` action. Refs such as `whiteboard-1` stay in URLs and API/MCP mechanics, never as visible row labels.

When adding a reusable component, document its template name, purpose, and expected data shape here.
